# Forecasting_StackOverflow_Questions
---
Working in a group of 3, we were tasked with forecasting out monthly StackOverflow question counts for both Python and R questions. There were multiple decision points
for this project, and we could have taken a vareity of different directions. After exploring the data and discussing the context behind the data, we were able to develop
a sound forecast! This repo contains the 12-month forecast csv of our predictions, the script that cleaned, explored, and forecasted the data, and lastly it contains the 
slideshow that explains the whole process!
