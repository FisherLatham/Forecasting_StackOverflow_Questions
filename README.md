# Forecasting_StackOverflow_Questions
---
Working in a group of 3, we were tasked with forecasting out monthly StackOverflow question counts for both Python and R questions. There were multiple decision points
for this project, so there vareity of different directions we could have taken this project. After exploring the data and discussing how to properly aggregate total questions, we were able to develop a sound forecast! This repo contains the 12-month forecast csv of our predictions, the script that cleaned, explored, and forecasted the data, and lastly it contains the slideshow that explains the whole process!
